                    <p>
                        Our family symbol came from a letter Tim Ryan wrote to the 
                        family during a difficult time. In this letter, later named 
                        the family dedication, he charged the older generation with 
                        being guardians over the rest of the family, each other and 
                        especially the younger generations. He charged the younger 
                        generation also as guardians of each other. You can find 
                        this letter here.
                    </p>

                        If you're blood its as simple as requesting access to the 
                        secure drive folder with the artwork. Then following the 
                        Intention of the symbol. We've designed this symbol not 
                        only with the existing members of our family in mind but 
                        all of our family whom have passed and all of our future 
                        family yet to come. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have someone who is not blood, keep the following 
                        in mind. This is for people who are family in our hearts 
                        and mind and if someone were to mention this particular 
                        person to someone else it would be obvious to us all that 
                        they are indeed family. If you have further questions about 
                        this please contact Bill Martin or Tim Ryan.

                    <h3>The Meaning and Rules of the Family Symbol Tattoo.</h3>

                    <p>
                        The leaf is to symbolize each of us individually on the family 
                        tree, as we each make up a leaf on the family tree. The tree in 
                        itself is what we consider to be our family, whether distant or 
                        immediate, blood or like blood we are all as one. The double infinity 
                        symbol is infinity times infinity, there is nothing greater than that 
                        just like there is nothing greater than the love we have for one another. 
                        It is an infinite amount of love and responsibility and honor we hold for 
                        one another and nothing can compare to our family. Nothing. It's a symbol 
                        that ties us all together no matter the amount of miles that keeps us apart.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keeping the integrity of this symbol is critical. If we don't hold true to 
                        the intention of the symbol its meaning will lessen for all of us. With this 
                        in mind we've established the following rules for the symbol.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You may put the symbol anywhere you would like, in any size you would like; 
                        However, we recommend that you place it somewhere you will see it every day 
                        and be reminded that you're part of a family that loves you and cares about 
                        you and like the tattoo is permanent in your life and will always be there 
                        for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You may only get the symbol using the stencils we provide to you. Also, The 
                        tattoo may only be in black. You may use any tattoo artist you wish, and should 
                        use the pictures posted as the tattoo artists' guide for proper shading. The 
                        intention is that when together we all have the same "brand" of our family. 
                        When others see this symbol, We want them to know that this is something special 
                        not just a cool tattoo or idea someone had one day. We wouldn't change the colors 
                        of the flag, nor will we change the design or color of our family symbol.
